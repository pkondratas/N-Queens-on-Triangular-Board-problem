        - returns the board 

    -  bool solvePlacement(Board *board, int board_size, int placed_queens, int current_row);
        function that by backtracking method finds whether it is possible to fit all the queens on the board in such way that they don't endanger each other
        - true, if the placement is found
        - false, if not found


    -  bool placementValidation(Board board, int queen_placement, int current_row);
        checks whether the queen in given coordinates endangers previously placed queens 
        - true, if placement is valid(doesn't endanger)
        - false, if not
